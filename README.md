# schematic2breadboardconverter

Hello fellas, I am trying to create a schematic to breadboard comverter where you can draw any schematic, choose the breadboard size and it will give you the breadboard diagram for it- similar to fritzing..it is just that in fritzing- you have to manually place and connect the items too which is confusing sometimes.
